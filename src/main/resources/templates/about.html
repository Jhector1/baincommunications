        <p >A smart home or office is just a few steps away. Imagine pausing a movie to have lights come
            on so you
            can find what youâ€™re looking for, or gathering with a group of friends to watch the big game on a beautiful
            outdoor television and home theater; a voice command to dim your lights,
            lower your shades and play your favorite music.
